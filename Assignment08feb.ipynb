    "Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "    In OOP, abstraction refers to obscuring intricate features and displaying only critical information. \n",
    "    It aids in the simplification of code and facilitates its comprehension. \n",
    "    This is frequently accomplished by using abstract classes and interfaces, which specify the shared \n",
    "    characteristics of a collection of objects without revealing specifics about how they were implemented.\n",
    "    For instance, we can use abstraction to express the characteristics that all cars have, \n",
    "    including the capacity to accelerate, brake, and turn.\n",
    "_________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Q2. Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    Abstraction means showing only the most important information and hiding the rest, \n",
    "    while encapsulation means putting data and methods together and controlling who can access them.\n",
    "    Encapsulation keeps things secure, while abstraction helps simplify things.\n",
    "    For example, think about a bank account. Abstraction would mean showing the user their balance,\n",
    "    but not showing them all the details of how it was calculated or stored. Encapsulation would group together\n",
    "    the balance data and methods for depositing and withdrawing money, and only allow authorized parts of the\n",
    "    program to access those methods to make sure the balance is updated correctly and safely.\n",

    "Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    The abc module in Python is used to create abstract classes.\n",
    "    An abstract class is a class that cannot be used on its own, but instead is meant to be subclassed by other classes.\n",
    "    You can create an abstract class using the ABC class and the @abstractmethod decorator to indicate which\n",
    "    methods must be implemented by any concrete subclasses.\n",
    "    Abstract classes are useful for defining interfaces or contracts that other classes must implement. \n",
    "    They can help make code more maintainable by ensuring a common interface or behavior across related classes\n",
    "__________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "     Data abstraction in object-oriented programming can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "     Abstract classes provide a way to define common functionality for a group of related classes, \n",
    "     while interfaces outline the methods that a class must implement. \n",
    "     This approach allows us to hide implementation details and only reveal necessary methods and properties.\n",
    "     By doing so, our code becomes more organized, adaptable, and manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Can we create an instance of an abstract class? Explain your answer. \n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    Unfortunately, it is not possible to create an instance of an abstract class.\n",
    "    An abstract class is one that has one or more abstract methods, or methods without implementation details. \n",
    "    Since an abstract method lacks implementation details, it cannot be invoked directly. So,\n",
    "    attempting to construct an instance of an abstract class would result in a runtime error.\n",

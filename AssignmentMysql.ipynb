    "Ans:\n",
    "    Data Manipulation Language (DML) can be defined as\n",
    "    a set of syntax elements that are used to manage the data in the database. \n",
    "    The commands of DML are not auto-committed and modification made by them are not permanent to the database. \n",
    "    It is a computer programming language that is used to perform select, insert, delete and update data in a database.\n",
    "    The user requests are assisted by Data Manipulation Language. \n",
    "    This language is responsible for all forms of data modification in a database.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    INSERT INTO Command\n",
    "This command can be used to insert data into a row of a table.\n",
    "INSERT INTO would insert the values that are mentioned in the ‘Student’ table below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "INSERT INTO NAME_OF_TABLE (1_column, 2_column, 3_column, …. N_column)\n",
    "\n",
    "VALUES (1_value, 2_value, 3_value, …. N_value);\n",

    "INSERT INTO NAME_OF_TABLE\n",
    "\n",
    "VALUES (1_value, 2_value, 3_value, …. N_value);\n",

    "Example:\n",

    "VALUES(‘Phoebe’, ‘1998-05-26’, 7812865845, ‘user@xyz.com’);\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE Command\n",
    "This statement in SQL is used to update the data that is present in an existing table of a database.\n",
    "The UPDATE statement can be used to update single or multiple columns on the basis of our specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "UPDATE name_of_table SET 1_coumn = 1_value, 2_coumn = 2_value, 3_coumn = 3_value, … , N_coumn = N_value\n",

    "\n",
    "condition: the condition used to select those rows for which the column values need to be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "UPDATE Student SET Phone = 9039462901 WHERE Stu_Name = ’Phoebe’;\n",
    "\n",
    "The WHERE clause in the preceding query is used to select the rows for which the columns need to be adjusted, \n",
    "and the SET statement has been used to assign new values to a particular column. \n",
    "If the WHERE clause is not used at all, then all of the rows’ columns will be modified. \n",
    "As a result, the WHERE clause is used to pick specific rows from the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the example query would update the phone number of the student with the name ‘Phoebe’.\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE Command\n",
    "The DELETE statement can be used in SQL to delete various records from a given table. \n",
    "On the basis of the condition that has been set in the WHERE clause, one can delete single or multiple records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "DELETE FROM name_of_table [WHERE condition];\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "DELETE FROM Student WHERE Stu_Name = ’Phoebe’;\n",
    "\n",
    "The command given above would delete the record for the student with the name ‘Phoebe’ from the ‘Student’ table. \n",

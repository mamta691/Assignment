    "## Q1. What is Bayes' theorem?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ans: Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that helps us update our beliefs or predictions about something based on new evidence or information. It involves calculating the probability of an event happening, \n",
    "         given some prior knowledge or assumptions we have about it and the new information we receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2. What is the formula for Bayes' theorem?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ans: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n",
    "            P(A|B) is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred\n",
    "            P(B|A) is the probability of event B occurring given that event A has occurred\n",
    "            P(A) is the probability of event A occurring \n",
    "            P(B) is the probability of event B occurring \n",
    "\n",
    "## Q3. How is Bayes' theorem used in practice?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ans: Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and is widely used in various practical applications. It is used in fields such as medical diagnosis, \n",
    "         spam filtering, financial forecasting, machine learning, and natural language processing. By updating prior probabilities with new information, Bayes' theorem helps to \n",
    "         make more accurate predictions and decisions based on available evidence. It is an important tool for analyzing uncertain situations and making informed judgments in a \n",
    "         wide range of fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q4. What is the relationship between Bayes' theorem and conditional probability?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ans: Bayes' theorem uses conditional probabilities to update prior beliefs about the likelihood of an event given new evidence. Conditional probability, on the other hand, \n",
    "         is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred.\n",
    "## Q5. How do you choose which type of Naive Bayes classifier to use for any given problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ans: Gaussian Naive Bayes is suitable for continuous data with a normal distribution. Multinomial Naive Bayes is used for discrete data such as word counts in text analysis.\n",
    "         Bernoulli Naive Bayes is similar to Multinomial, but is used for binary data. The selection of the most appropriate type of Naive Bayes classifier is based on the type \n",
    "         of input data and the specific problem at hand.\n",

    "## Q6. Assignment: You have a dataset with two features, X1 and X2, and two possible classes, A and B. You want to use NaiveBayes to classify a new instance with features X1 = 3 and X2 = 4. The following table shows the frequency of\n",

    "A 3 3 4 4 3 3 3\n",
    "B 2 2 1 2 2 2 3\n",
    "Assuming equal prior probabilities for each class, which class would Naive Bayes predict the new instance\n",
    "to belong to?\n",

    "\n",
    "P(X1=3,X2=4) = P(X1=3,X2=4|A) * P(A) + P(X1=3,X2=4|B) * P(B)\n",
